A tool to simulate (via SimGrid) the behaviour of scheduling algorithms.

Usage:
  batsim -p <platform_file> [-w <workload_file>...]
                            [-W <workflow_file>...]
                            [--WS (<cut_workflow_file> <start_time>)...]
                            [--sg-cfg <opt_name:opt_value>...]
                            [--sg-log <log_option>...]
                            [-r <hosts_roles_map>...]
                            [--events <events_file>...]
                            [--sched-cfg <cfg_str> | --sched-cfg-file <cfg_file>]
                            [options]
  batsim --help
  batsim --version
  batsim --simgrid-version

Input options:
  -p, --platform <platform_file>     The SimGrid platform to simulate.
  -w, --workload <workload_file>     The workload JSON files to simulate.
  -W, --workflow <workflow_file>     The workflow XML files to simulate.
  --WS, --workflow-start (<cut_workflow_file> <start_time>)  The workflow XML
                                     files to simulate, with the time at which
                                     they should be started.
  --events <events_file>             The files containing external events to simulate.

Most common options:
  -m, --master-host <name>           The name of the host in <platform_file>
                                     which will be used as the RJMS management
                                     host (thus NOT used to compute jobs)
                                     [default: master_host].
  -r, --add-role-to-hosts <hosts_role_map>  Add a `role` property to the specify host(s).
                                     The <hosts-roles-map> is formated as <hosts>:<role>
                                     The <hosts> should be formated as follow:
                                     hostname1,hostname2,..
                                     Supported roles are: master, storage, compute_node
                                     By default, no role means 'compute_node'
                                     Example: -r host8:master -r host1,host2:storage
  -E, --energy                       Enables the SimGrid energy plugin and
                                     outputs energy-related files.

  --disable-schedule-tracing         Disables the Pajé schedule outputting.
  --disable-machine-state-tracing    Disables the machine state outputting.

                                     0 means no limit [default: 0].
  --mmax-workload                    If set, limits the number of machines to
                                     the 'nb_res' field of the input workloads.
                                     If several workloads are used, the maximum

Job-related options:
  --forward-profiles-on-submission   Attaches the job profile to the job information
                                     when the scheduler is notified about a job submission.

                                     Without this options, such profiles would be
                                     garbage collected.

  --enable-compute-sharing           Enables compute resource sharing:

  --no-sched                         If set, the jobs in the workloads are
                                     computed one by one, one after the other,
                                     without scheduler nor Redis.
  --sched-cfg <cfg_str>              Sets the scheduler configuration string.
                                     This is forwarded to the scheduler in the first protocol message.
  --sched-cfg-file <cfg_file>        Same as --sched-cfg, but value is read from a file instead.
  --sg-cfg <opt_name:opt_value>      Forwards a given option_name:option_value to SimGrid.
                                     Refer to SimGrid configuring documentation for more information.
